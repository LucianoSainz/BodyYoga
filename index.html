                    <p>Better known as Handstand Paula, is a beloved yoga teacher at BodyYoga Miami Beach for the past 10 years. You’ll often catch her flying up into inversions and she’s passionate about teaching + uplifting her students to do the same!  Yogis love Paula’s classes for their strong sequencing, motivational + uplifting messages, fabulous playlists, challenging workout, core work and positivity + inspiration.</p><br>
                    <p>KiKi took her first Yoga class in California. She was introduced to vinyasa flow with a heavy focus on alignment. In Miami she completed a strict 200+hr training according to a traditional style from Mysore, India. That same year, she traveled to India to expand her practice. As KiKi continued into her next 200hr training she gained appreciation for Yoga from a more modern perspective. Teaching over the past few years in Miami has given students from all backgrounds a chance to discover KiKi’s warm, fun and challenging classes.</p>

                    <p>“I didn’t like ashtanga yoga on the first try, or the second, or the third; until I came to Miami BodyYoga. and now, I can’t imagine doing any other practice. Like most good things in life, it takes time. Ashtanga yoga definitely isn’t the yoga of instant gratification. With my amazing teachers, the journey has been unimaginable and the rewards trickle down well beyond the physical layer of the self”

                    <h3>Yarely Davis</h3>
                    <p>“Before I came to BodyYoga, Ashtanga yoga seemed out of reach. It looked like a practice for athletes and dancers. I am neither.
                        Initially, many of the fundamental poses were simply impossible. But in the space that BodyYoga provided for me to learn and practice I saw incremental, tiny but undeniable steps forward. These progressions added together over time transformed the impossible to possible.
                        It took six or seven months to get my legs into lotus. Now I do it everyday with ease. And so it was with many of the more advanced postures.
                        By consistently showing up and putting in effort over time Ashtanga yoga has transformed my life. It’s effects on the body are so profound as to have instilled a deep faith in the system. And the body is only the beginning- it’s just the way in.”</p>

                    <p>“Either if this life is a chapter of an endless book, or if we are just a ray of a huge star and if this body is a dress that we change countless times, my yoga has taught me that the present moment is all we have and the breath and body are gifts we have received to change the course of our lives… we use asana to unlock different places in our physical and subtle bodies and the breath works to unlock the doors of hidden emotions… the awareness that yoga gives us helps us to transform those emotions into positive actions that not only gracefully affect ourselves but also the people around us”</p>
